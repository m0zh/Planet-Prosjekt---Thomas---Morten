            <h1>Mars</h1>
          <p>
            Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a cold, desert-like world with a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide. Its reddish color comes from iron oxide in the soil, earning it the nickname "The Red Planet." Mars is home to the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the vast Valles Marineris canyon system. Scientists believe Mars once had liquid water, with ancient river valleys and lakebeds suggesting a wetter past. While no life has been found, ongoing exploration by rovers and orbiters seeks to uncover its mysteries, including the potential for microbial life beneath its surface.

            <h1>Mars´ surface</h1>
          <p>
            The surface of Mars is a rugged, windswept terrain covered in fine red dust and scattered with rocks, craters, and massive volcanoes. Its rusty color comes from oxidized iron in the soil. The planet experiences huge dust storms that can engulf the entire globe for months. Evidence of dried-up riverbeds, polar ice caps, and underground water reserves suggests Mars once had a more Earth-like climate. Gigantic geological features, like Olympus Mons, three times taller than Mount Everest, and Valles Marineris, stretching over 4,000 km, make it one of the most geologically diverse planets in the solar system.

          <h1>Mars Rover</h1>
          <p class="marsRover">
            NASA has sent several rovers to Mars to explore the planet’s surface
            and gather valuable scientific data. </br> Among the most notable are
            Spirit and Opportunity, which landed in 2004, Curiosity, which
            landed in 2012, and Perseverance, which arrived in 2021. </br> </br>These
            rovers have helped scientists study the Martian climate, geology,
            and potential for past microbial life. </br> </br> Perseverance, the most
            advanced rover to date, is equipped with high-tech instruments,
            including a drill for collecting rock samples and a small helicopter
            named Ingenuity, which made history as the first aircraft to fly on
            another planet. The data collected by these rovers brings us closer
            to understanding Mars' history and its potential for future human
            exploration.</p>
