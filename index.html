            <h1>Mars</h1>
          <p>
            Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a cold, desert-like world with a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide. Its reddish color comes from iron oxide in the soil, earning it the nickname "The Red Planet." Mars is home to the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the vast Valles Marineris canyon system. Scientists believe Mars once had liquid water, with ancient river valleys and lakebeds suggesting a wetter past. While no life has been found, ongoing exploration by rovers and orbiters seeks to uncover its mysteries, including the potential for microbial life beneath its surface.

            <h1>Mars´ surface</h1>
          <p>
            The surface of Mars is a rugged, windswept terrain covered in fine red dust and scattered with rocks, craters, and massive volcanoes. The planet experiences huge dust storms that can engulf the entire globe for months. Evidence of dried-up riverbeds, polar ice caps, and underground water reserves suggests Mars once had a more Earth-like climate. Gigantic geological features, like Olympus Mons, three times taller than Mount Everest, and Valles Marineris, stretching over 4,000 km, make it one of the most geologically diverse planets in the solar system.

          <h1>Mars Rover</h1>
          <p class="marsRover">
            NASA has sent several rovers to Mars to explore the planet’s surface
            and gather valuable scientific data. </br> Among the most notable are
            Spirit and Opportunity, which landed in 2004, Curiosity, which
            landed in 2012, and Perseverance, which arrived in 2021. </br> </br>These
            rovers have helped scientists study the Martian climate, geology,
            and potential for past microbial life. </br> </br> Perseverance, the most
            advanced rover to date, is equipped with high-tech instruments,
            including a drill for collecting rock samples and a small helicopter
            named Ingenuity, which made history as the first aircraft to fly on
            another planet. The data collected by these rovers brings us closer
            to understanding Mars' history and its potential for future human
            exploration.</p>

      <h1>Solar System</h1>
          <p>
           Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system, located between Earth and Jupiter. Mars is about half the size of Earth and has a thin atmosphere mostly made of carbon dioxide. It has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are believed to be captured asteroids.</br></br> Mars experiences seasons, polar ice caps, and the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. Scientists study Mars closely because of its similarities to Earth and its potential to support life in the past or even in the future..

          <h1>Mars Mission</h1>
          <p>
            The idea of colonizing Mars has been a major focus for space agencies like NASA and private companies like SpaceX. SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, has ambitious plans to send humans to Mars using the Starship spacecraft, aiming to establish a self-sustaining colony. NASA’s Artemis program and future missions, such as the Moon to Mars initiative, are also preparing for long-term human presence on the Red Planet.</br></br> Challenges for colonization include Mars' thin atmosphere, extreme temperatures, lack of liquid water, and radiation exposure. Scientists are exploring solutions like terraforming, underground habitats, and growing food in controlled environments. While a permanent Mars colony is still years away, advancements in technology and ongoing robotic missions are paving the way for human exploration and settlement in the future.
